# Question

Who sends the HTTP status code: the client or the server? What is the point of the status code?

# Answer
The server sends the HTTP status code. The status code tells us the results of the request; for example, a 404 code indicates that the clients request could not be completed because the information they are looking for cannot be found. A code in the 200s indicates that the request was successful.
