# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - will be eitehr true or false depending on the status of the response; if the response was successful, it will be true. If the response was unsuccessful, it will be false.

2. `Response.status` - Indicates whether or not the response was successful through status codes (200, 404, 301, etc.)

3. `Response.url` - Indicates the url of the response. This can help us ensure we're getting out response from the right place.

4. `Response.headers` - This provides access to the headers of the response. The headers provide metadata such as content length, type, etc.
